# Roll-Call-with-NodeJS-TS-and-Jest
Task given by Nexer and Husqvarna in May 2022. Based on: https://open.kattis.com/problems/rollcall 

## Installation
* Install NodeJS if you don't have it (NPM version 8.10.0 was used) - "npm install -g npm@8.10.0"
* Install these packages - "npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest"
* Install node-ts to run main file - "npm install -g ts-node" (YES, IT'S GLOBAL INSTALLATION FOR NOW, I AM SORRY)

## How to run
* Compile to build js-files used to run the program (must always be done before testing new changes) - "npm run build"
* Run all test files - "npm run test"
* Run index.ts to let the user try out some functionality of the class - "npm run start"

## To do
* Add client interface or API for user interaction
